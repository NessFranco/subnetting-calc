# subnetting-calc
SubnetCalc is an open-source repository dedicated to the development of a powerful subnetting tool designed to simplify and automate the process of subnet design for network administrators and IT professionals. This tool is engineered to calculate subnets tailored to specific networking scenarios, providing precise IP ranges and broadcast IPs

Features:

Custom Subnet Calculation: SubnetCalc allows users to define the specifics of their network, such as the main IP address and the number of required subnets and hosts, enabling precise subnet creation.

Automatic IP Range Generation: The tool automates the generation of IP ranges for each subnet, ensuring that they do not overlap and adhere to the specified network requirements.

Broadcast Address Calculation: SubnetCalc calculates the broadcast address for each subnet, saving users time and eliminating errors that can occur with manual calculations.

CIDR Notation Support: SubnetCalc supports Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation, enabling users to easily specify network size and IP ranges in a concise format.

Subnet Visualization: The tool provides a visual representation of the created subnets, making it easier to understand and manage complex network structures.

Export Functionality: Users can export the calculated subnets and network information in various formats, such as CSV, JSON, or plain text, for easy integration with other network management tools.

User-Friendly Interface: SubnetCalc offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it accessible to both novice and experienced network administrators.

Open Source: Being an open-source project, SubnetCalc encourages contributions from the community, fostering collaboration and continuous improvement.
